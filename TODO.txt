This file details the todo list for the GooDork3KWTB project
General Rules:
	*
	goo_operator:
		Regex Applications still need to be added in goo_operater.py
		the methods: inTitle,inBody,inScript,etc.. are 
	OUTPUT/INPUT TRANSFORMS:
	goo_xml:
		I haven't done any work on the xml parser, if you're going to contribute to this please make sure
		you do the following:
			*create a goo_xml class
			*have the goo_xml object parse the goo_result object
				into an xml file
			*you may encapsulate the file writting and output in goo_xml
			*make sure that goo_operator can parse the goo_operator.results
			in one call and have either an xml string be returned or the output file
			---whether it be a user supplied file, or stdout---written to.
			*please make provision for verbose output during file parsing
	goo_html:
			no work has been done here as yet
	goo_csv:
			no work has been done here as yet
	goo_JSON:
			no work has been done here as yet
		* I would also like the OUTPUT transform scripts mentioned about to be able
			to handle not only goo_result -> XML/CSV/JSON/HTML but also vice versa!

Keith Was To Busy  TODO list
      
       - Comment code out thoroughly for n00bs like me
       - Write my own driver GooDorkKWTB.py a n00bs friendly version this will also help me understand the code better
       - use argparse for the arguments
       - implement a parse that will parse the results to all formats easier.
       - Keep the current core
        
       - WISHLIST
          - GUI frontend for the n00bs that allow bulk downlods and other tasty n00b stuff.
